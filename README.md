# Elastic SIEM-Home-Lab  

![network-diagram](images/diag.png)




## Objectives

This lab simulates a network environment designed for monitoring and detection using the Elastic Stack. The setup includes:

- **Windows Server 2022 (10.10.10.150)**: Running Elastic-Agent and Sysmon for collecting logs and system events.
- **Ubuntu Server (10.10.10.160)**: Configured with Elastic-Agent and Sysmon for monitoring.
- **Windows Enterprise (10.10.10.155)**: Running Elastic-Agent and Sysmon to track events.
- **Kali Linux (10.10.10.140)**: Used for attack simulations to test the detection capabilities of the SIEM.
- **Elastic Stack Server (10.10.10.100)**: Hosted on Ubuntu, running Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet Server for log aggregation, visualization, and alerting.
- **Created and deployed a Mythic C2 payload, developed detection rules, and used Elastic  EDR to effectively detect and contain the compromised host



This setup allows for real-time monitoring and testing of security events using Sysmon data from all connected systems, with the goal of improving detection and response capabilities.

## Conclusion

*This project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive network monitoring and detection setup using the Elastic Stack. By integrating Elastic-Agent and Sysmon across a Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, and Windows Enterprise machine, real-time log collection and event tracking were achieved. Simulated attack scenarios using Kali Linux, along with the deployment of a Mythic C2 payload, enabled robust testing of the SIEMâ€™s detection capabilities. Custom detection rules and Elastic EDR further enhanced the ability to identify and contain threats effectively.*
